# 🐍 Python OOP: Operator Overloading (Less Than `<`)
## Name: HASMITHA V NANCY
## Reg No: 212224040111
## 🎯 AIM

To write a Python program that demonstrates **operator overloading** by overloading the **less than (`<`)** operator using a custom class.

---

## 🧠 ALGORITHM

1. **Create Class `A`**:
   - Define the `__init__()` method to initialize the object with a value `a`.

2. **Overload the `<` Operator**:
   - Define the `__lt__()` method with logic:
     - If `self.a < o.a`, return `"ob1 is less than ob2"`
     - Else, return `"ob2 is less than ob1"`

3. **Create Objects**:
   - Instantiate two objects `ob1` and `ob2` with values.

4. **Use `<` Operator**:
   - Use `print(ob1 < ob2)` to trigger the overloaded behavior.

## 💻 Program
~~~
  class A:
      def __init__(self, a):
          self.a = a
  
      def __lt__(self, other):
          if self.a < other.a:
              return "ob1 is less than ob2"
          else:
              return "ob2 is less than ob1"
  
  ob1 = A(10)
  ob2 = A(20)
  print(ob1 < ob2)  # Should print "ob1 is less than ob2"
  print(ob2 < ob1)  # Should print "ob2 is less than ob1"
~~~
## Output
![446373370-ca5556a8-8441-49fc-98ea-b46bb7db99a5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0698f3d2-c6fd-43b8-8c06-7b6b9e7e4179)

## Result
Thus, the program is verified successfully.
