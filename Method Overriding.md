# üêü Method Overriding-Fish and Shark Class Inheritance in Python
## Name: HASMITHA V NANCY
## Reg No: 212224040111
## üß† AIM:
To write a Python program that demonstrates class inheritance by creating a parent class `Fish` with a method `type`, and a child class `Shark` that overrides the `type` method.

## üìã ALGORITHM:

1. Define the `Fish` class with a method named `type()` that prints `"fish"`.
2. Define the `Shark` class as a subclass of `Fish`, and override the `type()` method to print `"shark"`.
3. Create an instance of the `Fish` class named `obj_goldfish`.
4. Create an instance of the `Shark` class named `obj_hammerhead`.
5. Use a `for` loop to iterate over both objects.
6. Within the loop, call the `type()` method using the loop variable.
7. Output will demonstrate method overriding: printing `"fish"` and `"shark"` accordingly.

## üíª PROGRAM:
~~~
class Fish:
    def type(self):
        print("fish")

class Shark(Fish):
    def type(self):
        print("shark")
obj_goldfish = Fish()
obj_hammerhead = Shark()
for fish in (obj_goldfish, obj_hammerhead):
    fish.type()
~~~
## OUTPUT
![446373074-50335279-eb56-452e-88d6-214d62f684b1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ab123b6-7d9c-4a82-aa72-1764e84a1659)

## RESULT
Thus, the program is verified successfully.
